# 3d Pony Creator#
Hello, I'm very happy you are here :3 So... I think you wonder what's this and how it's works...

I Created (or i'm still creating...) a tool used to create your own OC/Ponification. My assumptions are: Created in HTML5, no Flash (Sorry, but even Adobe is leaving from it), easy in use, powerful and most important - not only one pose. Just remember, it's still in progress, many functions are still not working, or are working unstable. But I'll be happy if you get me your feedback :).

##Usage
You need Node.JS in your server. If you have it installed, at first you must install needed packages using command ```bash npm install ``` in root application's directory. 

Server start command: ``` node app``` In default, it should start server in 8080 port. You can still change port in app.js file:

    app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 8080);

Just set "8080" to your port.
