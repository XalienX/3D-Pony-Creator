I think you wonder what's this and how it works...\r\n\r\nI Created (or i'm still creating...) a tool used to create your own OC/Ponification. My assumptions are: Created in HTML5, no Flash (Sorry, but even Adobe is leaving from it), easy in use, powerful and most important - not only one pose. Just remember, it's still in progress, many functions are still not working, or are working unstable. But I'll be happy if you get me your feedback :).\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nYou need Node.JS in your server. If you have it installed, at first you must install needed packages using command ```bash npm install ``` in root application's directory. \r\n\r\nServer start command: ``` node app``` In default, it should start server in 8080 port. You can still change port in app.js file:\r\n\r\n    app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 8080);\r\n\r\nJust set \"8080\" to your port.\r\n\r\nLive demo: http://mlppolska.pl:8087\r\n\r\n*******************************************************\r\n\r\n##ToDo List:\r\n\r\n- [ ]  Adding CM\r\n- [ ]  Save to server\r\n- [ ]  Users Gallery\r\n- [ ]  Eyes, Tail, Mane etc...\r\n- [x]  ColorPicker for background and colors of pony\r\n- [x] User-Friendly change position and scale \r\n- [x] Save/Load from Json\r\n- [x] Export to PNG File  ","google":"UA-30567770-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
